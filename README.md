-Conditional forwarding: Set up forwarding servers based on domain names

- Multiple record types:

- A records: IPv4 address resolution

- AAAA records: IPv6 address resolution

- CNAME records: Domain aliases

- MX records: Mail server configuration

- TXT records: Text information (SPF, DKIM, DMARC, etc.)

- SRV records: Service discovery

- Forwarding: Supports upstream DNS server forwarding for complete DNS solutions

- Caching: Intelligent caching to improve query performance

### DHCP Server
